            <p>Born and raised twenty five miles east of Cleveland, Ohio I've lived in the greater Cleveland area my entire life.  A graduate of Cleveland State University, my formal education is in Mechanical Engineering.  I first became interested in coding while completing course work in C++ and MatLab.  Around that same time I worked on a data-mining project at an internship where I was introduced to VBA.</p> 
            <p>Now I enjoy working with modern web technologies and have a number of projects competing for my attention.  This is all thanks to the vast community of developers who have taken time to share their experiences for the benefit of others.  My purpose in creating this site is to contribute back to that community.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-0">Manufacturing</h4>
          <p>I've worked in manufacturing for the majority of my professional life.  In my current role, my primary function  is to develop and maintain processes on CNC equipment.  I'm directly responsible for five machines that range from twin-turret turning, to 4- and 5-axis milling platforms.  I'm excited about the work my team is doing to advance our implementation of the enterprise CAM package.  I like to think of CNC code, or "G-code", as another programming language and the CAM software as the development environment.  In the future, I would like to bring some of the tools and concepts from software development over to the manufacturing world.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-0">Quality</h4>
          <p>While working as Quality Engineer, my primary responsibility was to assess and mitigate risk related to customer returns.  Typically, this would mean leading a small cross-functional team through a disciplined problem solving process.  In this role, my knowledge and appreciation of applied statistics grew immensely.  I took particular interest in process capability studies, statistical process control (SPC), design of sampling plans (or average outgoing quality, AOQ) and design of experiments (DOE).</p>

          <h4 class="mt-0">Design</h4>
          <p>I worked on a product design team as a co-op while I was in college.  When I finished school, I was given the opportunity to join the team as an applications engineer. The work I did was pretty typical for a product design role. I would start by getting an understanding the customer's application and  defining the requirements.  Then I would work with the manufacturing & assembly teams to design a solution and get a quote back to the customer.  While I was in this role I helped maintain an Access database that was used to store information about the customer requests and generate metrics on things like ticket complexity, the team's response time, and how requests would transform into sales.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-0">Code</h4>
          <p>Coding is something that I got into as a hobby and never got bored with.  In fact, it's just the opposite, the more I learn the more I want to do.  That drive has lead to me volunteer as tech-support with a local non-profit that focuses on addiction recovery.</p>
          <p>I have a family member that is employed at this organization and I found myself explaining the interworkings of an Access database at family functions.  I ended up getting introduced to the director and working with them over about a six month period to configure and update their central database which was built years earlier by another volunteer.</p>
          <p> More recently, I've been trying to get some exposure to a broader set of technologies.  I've had an affinity for .NET for a while now, and I don't see that changing, but I want to be more proficient with front-end web development.  Now that I've got this site going, the next thing I want to look at is Node JS.  I'm the beginning stages of planning good sized  project and I want to be more informed about the different tech stacks before I start writing code.</p>        </div>

          <h4 class="mt-0">Building</h4>
          <p>Outside of computers and software, I think I've built some pretty cool stuff.  I've built two electric guitars, a gas fireplace with a custom surround and oak mantle, and custom cabinets for my basement.  I'm planning on keeping the content on this site pretty focused on tech and developer topics but, once in a while you might see an article about power tools or guitars.</p>
